# SQL dump cleaner script in Python
Python script to easily clean a SQL dump folder (C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\Polybase\dump). (Jan. 2022)

I was tired of manually deleting all the files in this folder and then emptying the trash so I created a script that does the job for me in 2 clicks !

Change the folder path in main.py to clean an other folder entirely.
